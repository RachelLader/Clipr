the challenger astronauts died the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed explosion this well documented fact see the rogers commission report for example what looked like explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart the forces the crew cabin were not sufficient kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according the kerwin team medical forensic report the astronauts were killed when the more less intact cabin hit the water circa mph and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team examined them they were sent off buried using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit because can get there big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even you fill part the cargo bay with tanks furthermore not particularly sensible because much that weight things like wings which are totally useless except the immediate vicinity the earth the shuttle orbiter highly specialized for travel between earth surface and low orbit taking higher enormously costly and wasteful much better approach would use shuttle subsystems build specialized high

astronaut will assume you mean nasa astronaut since probably impossible for non russian get into the cosmonaut corps paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have few astronauts and fly even fewer that you better off hoping win lottery becoming shuttle pilot requires lots fast jet experience which means military flying career forget that unless you want anyway you want become shuttle mission specialist you aren citizen become one that must after that the crucial thing remember that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply nasa problem not finding qualified people but thinning the lineup down manageable length not enough qualified you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason many them principle quite irrelevant the job get specialize something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely will done from the ground for the fore seeable future degree one field plus work experience another seems frequent winner good physical condition with good eyesight not get radial keratomy similar hack improve your vision nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would rked eyes and long term effects are poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknowns you can pass jet pilot physical you should okay you can your chances are poor practise public speaking and conservative and conformist appearance and actions you got tough selling job ahead trying convince cautious conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds other applicants and also that you will credit nasa after you are hired public relations significant part the job and nasa image very prim and proper the image you want squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need security clearance some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get pilot license and make flying

following answer and translation are provided ken jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc says during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude commanded until loaded rel sufficient assure launch tower clearance achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle heads down attitude required generate negative alpha which turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved band look angles and crew view the horizon the tilt maneuver also required start gaining downrange velocity achieve the main engine cutoff meco target second stage this really good answer but couched nasa jargon try interpret wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling then roll the shuttle around that the angle attack between the wind caused passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge slightly negative angle negative alpha this causes little bit downward force toward the belly the orbiter the direction and this force alleviates structural loading have careful about those wings they about the most delicate part the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also allows carry more mass orbit achieve higher orbit with the same mass change the orbit higher lower inclination than would the case didn roll performance gain the new attitude allows the crew fly less complicated flight path they had execute one the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae have good line sight signal with the band radio antennae the orbiter improved band look angles the new attitude allows the crew see the horizon which helpful but not mandatory part piloting any flying machine the new attitude orients the shuttle that the body more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose the east usually this allows the thrust from the engines add velocity the correct direction eventually achieve orbit remember velocity vector quantity made both speed and direction the shuttle has have large horizontal component its velocity and very small vertical component attain orbit this all begs the question why isn the launch pad oriented give this nice attitude begin with why does the shuttle need roll achieve that attitude the answer that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects this any daytime launch the srm exhaust dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn side note the saturn also had roll program don ask why shuttle guy checked with buddy ascent dynamics added that the roll maneuver really maneuver all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component that maneuver performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading the wings keeping the angle attack alpha within tight tolerance the yaw component used determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver really expressed quaternion grad level math concept for combining all three rotation matrices one four element array how receive the nasa channel nasa select

successful probe flyby venus december and returned information which confirmed that venus very hot degrees fahrenheit now revised degrees world with cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed mariner launched november was lost when its protective shroud failed eject the craft was placed into interplanetary space unable collect the sun energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and now solar orbit was intended for mars flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe mariner did reach mars and took the first close images the martian surface all flew the planet the probe found cratered world with atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was dead world both the geological and biological sense mariner was sent venus reconfirmed the data that planet collected five years earlier mariner plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure its surface least times that earth the equivalent being feet under the surface ocean mariner and were sent mars and expanded upon the work done mariner four years earlier however they failed take away the concept mars dead planet first made from the basic measurements mariner mariner ended the atlantic ocean when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner the sister probe mariner became the first craft orbit mars returned information the red planet that other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes the martian surface well giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup images mars two small moons phobos and deimos mariner used venus gravity assist mercury the probe did return the first close images the venusian atmosphere ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet four earth days mariner eventually made three flybys mercury from before running out attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury heavily cratered world with mass much greater than thought this would seem indicate that mercury has iron core which makes percent the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters pioneer through failed meet their main objective photograph the moon close but they did reach far enough into space provide new information the area between earth and the moon including new data the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer was launched october pioneer november and pioneer december pioneer was moon probe which missed the moon and became the first spacecraft orbit the sun pioneer was originally designed flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out million kilometers record until mariner pioneer through were placed into solar orbit from pioneer and are still transmitting information this time pioneer would have been number suffered launch failure pioneer became the first spacecraft flyby jupiter pioneer followed and then went become the first probe study saturn both vehicles should continue function through and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever pioneer venus also known pioneer venus orbiter pioneer burned the venusian atmosphere october pvo made the first radar studies the planet surface via probe pioneer venus also known pioneer sent four small probes into the atmosphere december the main spacecraft bus burned high the atmosphere while the four probes descended parachute towards the surface though none were expected survive the surface the day probe did make and transmitted for minutes the ground before its batteries failed ranger lunar lander and impact missions ranger and were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing but rocket problems left them useless low orbits which quickly decayed ranger launched january was intended land instrument capsule the surface the moon but problems during the launch caused the probe miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger did try take some images the moon flew but the camera was unfortunately aimed deep space during the attempt ranger launched april had the same purpose ranger but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed the lunar farside the first probe reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger launched october and similar ranger and lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger through had more modified lunar missions they were send back live images the lunar surface they headed towards impact with the moon ranger failed this objective when its cameras did not operate ranger through performed well becoming the first lunar probes return thousands lunar images through lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through were designed orbit the moon and image various sites being studied landing areas for the manned apollo missions the probes also contributed greatly our understanding lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside all five probes the series launched from were essentially successful their missions they were the first probes orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface avoid interference with the manned apollo missions surveyor lunar soft landers the surveyor series were designed primarily see apollo lunar module could land the surface the moon without sinking into the soil before this time was feared some that the moon was covered great layers dust which would not support heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful proving that the lunar surface was strong enough hold spacecraft from only surveyor and were unsuccessful missions the rest became the first probes soft land the moon taking thousands images and scooping the soil for analysis apollo landed feet from surveyor and returned parts the craft earth surveyor the last the series was purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region viking mars orbiters and landers viking was launched from cape canaveral florida august titan centaur rocket the probe went into martian orbit june and the lander set down the western slopes chryse planitia july soon began its programmed search for martian micro organisms there still debate whether the probes found life there not and sent back incredible color panoramas its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was pinkish color not dark blue they originally thought the sky pink due sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles the thin atmosphere the lander set down among field red sand and boulders stretching out far its cameras could image the viking orbiter kept functioning until august when ran out attitude control propellant the lander was switched into weather reporting mode where had been hoped would keep functioning through but after november errant command had been sent the lander accidentally telling shut down until further orders communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through may interesting side note viking lander has been designated the thomas mutch memorial station honor the late leader the lander imaging team the national air and space museum washington entrusted with the safekeeping the mutch station plaque until can attached the lander manned expedition viking was launched september and arrived martian orbit august the lander touched down september utopia planitia accomplished essentially the same tasks its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had series attitude control gas leaks which prompted being shut down that july the lander was shut down april the orbits both viking orbiters should decay around voyager outer planet flybys voyager was launched september and flew past jupiter march and saturn november voyager was launched august before voyager and flew jupiter august saturn august uranus january and neptune august voyager took advantage rare once every years alignment slingshot its way from outer planet outer planet voyager could principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing titan close between the two probes our knowledge the giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense voyager discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae three new satellites were discovered two the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects the jovian magnetosphere when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over ringlets and satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance year great white spot band cycle known titan atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger aspects the rings braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult explain voyager thanks heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly monochromatic appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found ariel and miranda was bizarre patchwork different terrains satellites and one more ring were discovered contrast uranus neptune was found have rather active weather including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out bright patches one ring two other rings and other satellites were discovered neptune magnetic axis was also skewed triton had canteloupe appearance and geysers what liquid the two voyagers are expected last for about two more decades their target journeying gives negative evidence about

freedom shuttle performed nasa center the center skims off portion which goes into what amounts slush fund this money used fund work the center manager wants fund this sum estimated over third the funds allocated think about that the billion cost freedom fully billion won spent anything having anything with space stations now maybe that billion was wisely spent and maybe wasn but the work done with should stand its own merits not distorting the cost other projects congress has idea the existense these wraps congress has never heard the term center tax they look the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that doesn add they wonder this blissfully unaware that third the money going for something else dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here couple weeks ago when first read this your posting talked with one the cost experts here space station headquarters you wondering why didn post response immediately have real job supposed doing here headquarters digging old khz data looking into sherzer kyger claims rates pretty low the totem pole priority also spent last weekend kansas city the national science teachers association conference extolling the virtues ssf science teachers first off yes the concept center tax wrap does exist recall the numbers correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year around million this was computed adding the and center taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year billion calculater says the tax percentage over the life the ssf program using your figure billion for the cost ssf tax rate comes million this alot less than billion but will concede still appreciable amount pocket change should note that your estimate the tax rate could close the actual rate the tax only charged funds that are spent the center kind like mcdonalds some states where you have pay sales tax you eat the food the restaurant but you don you get take out for example the vast bulk the funds receive the rocketdyne contract and are not subject the center tax don have the numbers front but guess least the funds rocketdyne you could right about tax rate but only applied funds spent the center and not the prime contracts this leads the obvious question what the government doing with ssf funds that don the prime contractors gets slice the billion pie big portion this slice goes rocketdyne what happens the balance the funds which aren eaten the center tax call these funds spend house supporting development funds they are supporting the development work done rocketdyne have used these funds setup our own testbed checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed has real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research few years back with lead acid car batteries simulate the nickel hydrogen batteries ssf switchgear converter units and simulated loads data from the testbed was used recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability the power system have also used the supporting development money purchase nickel hydrogen batteries which are life testing both lewis and the crane naval facility indiana side point the battery cells test recently hit the four year life test milestone cells have completed cycles the orbit batteries through cycles per year final example home division lewis used the supporting development funds purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling the performance the electrical power system availability calculations using monte carlo simulation setting database with information weight the power system elements finally the money raised the tax does not all into slush fund lewis the director does control small discretionary fund each year any individual lewis can submit proposal the director get money from this fund look pretty much anything within the lewis charter most the tax however goes fund the general services the center like the library the central computer services division the contractor who removes the snow etc thus rather difficult determine what percentage the ssf budget doesn for ssf activities get accurate figure you would have take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide the amount the library funds used support ssf which would hard compute itself how would you figure out what percentage the bill for aviation week for year billable ssf would you base the person hours ssf employees spend reading week versus the rest the center personnel you would then have compare this estimate the ssf portion the library expense with the portion the tax that goes support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays the tax run the library but underpay for snow removal talk about burecratic nightmare last point that can believe your claim that congress has never heard the term center tax unfortunately all the nasa testimony before congress isn computer can simple word search someplace prove you wrong but surely some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost methods were documented for congress

thinks should done address instead just complaining about his doing fred again you really don get what the complaints are about you not incredibly clear explanation complaints something between feelings regarding nick method and judgments about his meaning maybe get you said what the complaints are about rather than doing the same things that you mean complain about when you trash people how supposed read that trashing people bad gee funny that you get now then deliberate obtuseness perhaps fred issue nick alleged trashing others only got when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead allegorically that was point all along fred not only you the same thing the net honestly reporting your ideas matters policy and projects space but your response was just baiting not even part debate have yet see nick enter into anything remotely resembling debate see him flame anyone anything who disagrees with the one true szabo plan see him attacking people calling them lazy bastard because they had the temerity disagree with the almight nick see him questioning peoples ethics again because they had the temerity disagree with lord god szabo but debate bwaaaaahhhaaaa glad you can laugh since your ratio debate insult about the same not even close tommy and generally only when dealing with someone like nick see are dealing with problem conflict interpretations not least which your belief that only you can adequately judge what and not debate suffice say that disagree with you that last point why don you take poll fred you want some psuedo objective point view and usual you defend your insults with started yeah took some his research and called own but started what stole his car stole lawnmower first besides that think still open interpretation whether nick actually did start your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part the sentence which occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds the guy that broke the borrowed tool never borrowed already gave back and was broken when you gave make yer mind fred not convinced that people are necessary all parts every space based process and your response doesn tell thing about the reasons why you think they should except impune the motives the person with divergent opinion who said think they should tommy show note where said that and eat this terminal see below fred fred cocluded that you did since you took issue with the fact that conclusion was incorrect that you were taking issue with something different evidence that your communication style confusing evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate first try address what think you meant for which rewarded with denial sorts and smart remark then point out that not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you second time and stupid for just can win can fred you got great point here somewhere just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding your valuable opinions you never actually get around making please quote the took issue with believe you will see you look that what was and taking issue with szabo idea that the manned program should scrapped until such time his toaster based infrastructure finished all hail the szabo plan fred issue nick alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists your mind instead nick you would have really good point instead you have provided good reason ignore your insults since they are based incorrect interpretations that you have made about others forgive for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had reading what nick actually said that people aren required all parts all space processes your taking issue with his opinions regarding people the space program read people are required all parts all space processes help out here fred since patently stupid did you read nick wrong are you going eat your terminal now the latter sure hope one those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point not stupid because your incorrect assumption only stupid insulted you for having made but alas that your job fred and finally your style confusing since you tried make two points simultaneously with allegory insult sadly one point addressed plan that only existed your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you much anyone more deliberate lack understanding tommy finally got you don like the plan that nick posts made you imagine and you don like nick obnoxious behavior even though worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone dense myself you have problem with nick delivery address that the way you bait you perpetuating the lack discourse that you complain tommy the bait that which elicits the response nick baits just flame him for being obnoxious fool don really care who started read this list get information and other views the issues which was dedicated not your mom started did hear about why nick very bad guy you think flaming bad stop flaming least get the point the first post instead explaining yourself all the time that nice tommy when you pay post the net you can complain about not getting your money worth perhaps you weren deliberately too thick get the point the first time wouldn have waste time explaining myself all the time course socrates how could otherwise think neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly admonitions about how such things should handled outside usenet were somewhat rebuffed being little hypocritical tommy with the immaturity this just the pique net ghod wannabe who got turned down someone thought was new and hence could instructed tommy saw you come the net who cares who came the net first you consider that you saw come after brief haitus before which was for about years you had seen the net first you remember when nick and went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior just amazing that you continue take issue with behavior that worse than your own let see here complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn and complaints about your name calling are immature while your name calling isn yeah right maybe you called some more names might see better fred net ghod wannabe naturally fred you correctly interpreted motivations when yours are impossible judge from your actions your insulting people that try proves didn really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what really wanted was impress everyone only put complaints with your behavior private mail not because belongs there but because thought you were such jerk that you bring back the net playing right into

space including but not limited layout lunar colony tele operating machines for work and play disseminating educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides new way for students worldwide participate twenty first century remote learning methods because the nature the ltm project people all ages interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures interfacing and electronics software and graphics operation ltm evolving playground and laboratory that can used children students and professionals worldwide using personal computer home terminal participating institution user able tele operate real models the ltm base for experimental recreational purposes because real facility exists ample opportunity provided for media coverage the construction the lunar model its operation and new features added suggested the users themselves this has broad inherent interest for wide range groups tele operations and virtual reality research radio control model railroad and ham radio operation astronomy and space planetariums and science centers art and theater bbs and online network users software and game

lunar colony elements scenery and machine lets the ltm initial design has tele operated machinelets ssto scale model which will able lift off hover and land bulldozerlet which will able move about quarry area and moon train which will traverse most the simulated lunar surface each machinelet has small camera utilizing ccd chip mounted personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture content and doing data compression allow for minimal images sent the operator for control purposes and also return control signals the first machinelet set will the moon train since model trains with cameras built are almost off the shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping train are minimal the user will receive image once every seconds depending the speed their data link ltm next ssto scale model with ccd chip will suspended from servo motor operated wire frame mounted the ceiling allowing for the ssto controlled the operator take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank models will modified ccd chip equipped bulldozerlets the entire initial ltm will allow remote operators worldwide receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing work the entire system based commercially available items and parts that can easily obtained except for the interface electronics which well within the capability many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software developers taking graphically oriented communications program dmodem and adding tele operations screen and controls the necessary user interface can provided under man hours plan action the diaspar virtual reality network has agreed sponsor this project providing host computer network and internet access that network diaspar providing the foot foot facility for actual construction the lunar model diaspar has stock the electronic tanks that can modified and one ccd chip diaspar also agrees provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communications package and modify for control the machines lets initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will performed for live photo session and news conference april the initial models will put place time lapse record will started for historical purposes not expected that this event will completely serious solemn the lunar colony will declared open for additional building operations and experiments photographer will present and the photographs taken will converted gif images for distribution world wide major online networks and bbs press release will issued calling for contributions ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony contest for new designs and techniques for working the moon will then announced universities will invited participate the goal being find instructors who wish have class participation various aspects the lunar colony model field trips ltm can arranged and that time the results the class work will added the model contributors will then able tele operate any contributed machine lets once they return their campus monthly ltm newsletter will issued both electronically online and via conventional means the media any major new tele operated equipment addition will marked with invitation the television news media having large real model space colony will very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will controlled people all over the world science fiction writers will invited issue challenges engineering and human factors students universities build and operate the tele operated equipment perform lunar tasks using counter weight and pulley systems gravity may simulated some extent try various traction challenges the long term goal creating world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation lunar colony ltm has the potential being long term global edutainment method for space activities and may the generic example how teach and explore many other subject areas not limited space edutainment all this facilitates the kind spirit which can lead generation people who are ready for the leap the stars conclusion edutainment the blending education and entertainment anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purposes creating tele operated model lunar colony not only create world wide publicity but also method trying new ideas

sci.space	nasa wraps article apr iti org aws iti org allen sherzer writes article apr judy edu wingo cspara decnet fedex msfc nasa gov writes don care who told you this not generally true see every single line item contract and have sign there such thing wrap this university dennis have worked written proposals worth tens millions customers included government including nasa for profit and non profit companies all expected wrap usually called fee much the work involved allocating and costing the work subcontractors the subcontractors where universities for profits non profits and even some the nasa centers for the commercialization space all charged fees part the work down the street one the nasa commercialization centers they charge fee you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen that post you stated that the wrap was top and addition any overhead geez this post you finally admit that this not true now sure your competent engineer dennis but you clearly lack experience several areas your posts show that you don understand the importance integration large projects you also show lack understanding costing efforts shown your belief that reasonable charge incremental costs for everything this isn flame jsut statement come your little buns down here and you will find out who doing what and who working integration this simply hominum attack and you know your employer does charge fee you may not see but you course there fee for administration geez allen any organization has costs but there heck difference legitimate costs such libraries and other things that must there support program and wrap you originally stated you stated that wrap was top all the overhead which couple sentences down you say not true which allen sounds like they are adding their overhead rate ask your costing people how much fee they add project did they never heard but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this included the overhead well there you are dennis said they simply include the fee their overhead many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending the customer you have posted this subject allen you state that wrap over and above overhead and seperate charge you admit here that this wrong nasa has line item budget every year have seen allen get some numbers from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl high heaven about until you that you are barking the wind allen you did not you merely repeated allegations made employee the overhead capital nasa integration dennis isn overhead nothing that reston does could not dont better cheaper the other nasa centers where the work going integration could done better the centers apollo integration was done here msfc and that did not turn out bad the philosophy reston totally wrong allen there you have bunch people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying oversee there way that will ever work has never worked any large scale project that was ever tried could you imagine reston like set for apollo dennis reston has been the only nasa agency working reduce costs when was hemoraging out billion the centers you love much where doing their best cover and ignore the problem reston was the only place you would find people actually interested solving the problems and building station you are full allen this one agree that jsc screwed big they should responsible for that screw and the people that caused replaced make stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes come msfc for couple weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want believe matter what the facts are contrary kinda funny isn that someone who talks about problem like this place where everything overhead when you have bit more experience dennis you will realize that integration isn overhead the single most important part successful large scale effort agree that integration the single most important part successful large scale effort what completly disagree with seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the work called leadership allen that what made apollo work final responsibility for the success apollo was held less than people that leadership and responsibility there neither when you have any organization set reston you could take the same people and move them jsc msfc and they could much better job why did take year for reston finally say something about the problem they were site and part the process then the problem would have never gotten out hand the first place there one heck lot not know allen but one thing know that for project successful you must have leadership remember all the turn over reston that kept ssf program shambles for years you lack responsibility and leadership that the programs problem lack leadership from the white house congress and reston nasa only symptom greater national problem you are narrowly focused your efforts that you not see this why did the space news artice point out that was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems methinks that you are being selective with the facts again the story you refer said that some nasa people blamed congress suprise suprise the fact remains that the centers you support much who covered the overheads and wouldn address the problems until the press published the story are you saying the reston managers where wrong get nasa address the overruns you approve what the centers did cover the overruns saying that they were located jsc never would have happened the first place takes four flights year resupply the station and you have cost million flight then you pay billion year you stated that your friend reston said that with the current station they could resupply for billion year the wrap were gone this merely points out blatent contridiction your numbers that understandably you fail see you should know dennis that nasa doesn include transport costs for resuply that comes from the shuttle budget what they where saying that operational costs could cut half plus transport sorry gang but have deadline for satellite someone else going have allen math for him for while will have little chance hope you can find the time tell just why was wrong reston ask that the problems with addressed have the time reitereate one more timet that the leadership that reston was site jsc the problem never would have happened totally ignoring the lack leadership congress this many headed hydra that has grown nasa the true problem the agency and try change the question suit you and your bias only indicative your position dennis university alabama huntsville

the fluid like margarita blender and ingest converting distilling localized mass time and energy non spinning lattice dark matter the earth isn exactly spinning around the sun picture image galaxy haven any videos them spinning picture being stationary and the sun image being dragged across the sky the spinning ether field picture onion each layer which spinning little faster than the next thread shot the inner kernel would stretched diagonally sideways its head being faster shell than its tail until finally intersected the ground the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but its foot print being line not point sunrise sunset the moon isn exactly orbiting parasite non self spin sustaining being dragged the earth ether field which itself the sun much more powerful field our seasons are the wobble earth axis like top slowing down the orbit the earth around the sun all the stars images being dragged around the sun ether feild the earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance apart its just that the time between them varies greatly because the path not the same the moon lattice the ether like sticking fork plate spaghetti and giving the plate half turn the sun lattice has much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate noodles wound the piece light going the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make hook the end the piece light going the sun has around the whole plate like needle record before gets there with pencil compass and rule draw diagram how the moon can about big earth shadow upon and other times totally eclipse the sun look the sky except for your knowledge would you guess that they are about the same size just because they look about the same size the full moon quarter moon etc the difference between rate ether spins what are looking rotating turntable view the moon only half which facing the sun seen half moon within about degrees sky the sun during the day try and draw that earth shadow its only the moon image which appears orbit matter where the light part the part facing the sun and the dark part the half facing away from the sun even when appears behind light years between galaxies misnomer the distance closer zero time and matter are characteristics this phase reality which dissipates outward with each layer the onion defining edge ether spin what are seeing could essentially happening now the piece light may have experienced many years but the trip could very quick our time time travel warp space might consider learning spin myself phase out mass good luck trying design propulsion system drag around space time locality its like trying move balloon shooting squirt gun from within find out about all this recommend studying history look the book life holy grail etc brain waves just might carry decipherable data start looking some part the spectra said unusable due all the background noise billion humans totally isolate myself record thinking dog backwards and learn read what got microsoft holy grail card for pentium next concluding that thoughts were recorded non time bound media the ether and that who move forward time would try temporarily locally reverse the flow

thanks major design refinements implemented recent months jpl space infrared telescope facility sirtf major project considered trouble couple years ago alive and well according project scientist michael werner lighter spacecraft revised orbit and shorter mission have added less expensive project with tremendous scientific power and bright future said werner designed follow the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite iras and cosmic background explorer cobe missions sirtf cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space scheduled for launch plans proceed scheduled iras pioneering work space based infrared astronomy years ago allowed astronomers view the milky way never before and revealed among other things galaxies and comets provided sky survey times more sensitive than any previously available from ground based observations cobe has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation large angular scales and revealed new facts about the early universe but illuminate sirtf potential jim evans jpl manager astrophysics and fundamental physics pre projects recently said that the project million times more capable than iras based technological advances infrared detector arrays however despite the enormous strides infrared exploration sirtf promised and the fact that was cited the highest priority new initiative for all astronomy the the national academy sciences took diet die directive from nasa headquarters last year keep the project going according werner the project now known atlas sirtf based the key factor its new design the satellite will orbit the sun instead the earth permitting the use atlas rocket launch instead the formerly proposed and heavier titan the main advantage the solar orbit that you can use all your launch capability for boosting the payload you don have carry second rocket circularize the orbit werner said the other advantage solar orbit said that better thermal environment away from the heat the earth additional major changes sirtf redesign include shortening the mission from five three years and building spacecraft that less than half heavy the original plan atlas sirtf will weigh kilograms pounds compared titan sirtf kilograms pounds all that adds less stressful launch environment werner said and cost savings more than million for the launch addition increased savings the design the smaller less massive spacecraft werner said sirtf redesign came result congress telling nasa you trying too many things you want support sirtf which good project develop plan see how fits into nasa overall strategy shortly thereafter sirtf was named nasa highest priority flagship scientific mission the interdisciplinary space sciences advisory committee addition the blessing from the national academy sciences while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping keep the project alive sirtf major scientific contribution always promised come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays which will allow images developed tens thousands times faster than before according evans until couple years ago werner said all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors very small arrays individually assembled detectors since then the department defense has developed program produce arrays tens hundreds thousands detectors rather than just few and those are very well suited for use sirtf werner noted that addition dealing with budget pressures congress currently watching nasa projects with eye out for any technological spinoff that question think have some things say said because the detectors using are straight off various military developments also sirtf will built the aerospace industry and real technological and engineering challenge addition being tremendous scientific project sirtf will used the entire astronomical community werner added but the revised three year mission puts premium observing time have educate the user community and develop program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround the data werner said the downsizing the project required reduction scope and complexity sirtf three instruments the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer however these reductions will only result losses efficiency rather than capability said the project hopes start phase activity which will provide detailed concept for development and design building the hardware would begin about two years later projected cost estimates evans said are million million very optimistic about sirtf said will provide tremendous return for the investment werner added that additional benefit from the project will the enrichment our intellectual and cultural environment people the street are very

maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating the development the space vlbi project recently approved jpl flight project set for launch space vlbi will utilize two earth orbiting spacecraft the japanese vsop vlbi space observing program satellite with its meter radio telescope and russian radioastron meter satellite both spacecraft will team with ground based radio telescopes located around the world create radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power factor japan vsop satellite will use limited six hour orbit conduct imaging science while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit larger hour earth orbit conduct exploratory radio astronomy each satellite will point source target for roughly hours while approximately ground based radio telescopes will simultaneously point the same source object while within view earth according joel smith jpl project manager for the space vlbi meetings like those held jpl will permit japan and russia who have little previous experience radio interferometry establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will vital during the complex observations required the space vlbi project one our main activities developing the methodology for international coordination because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground based radio telescopes observe the same celestial objects said smith three new tracking antennas are being built dsn facilities and other three other tracking facilities located japan russia and green bank this global network ground based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high speed recorders collect observation data and forward the information correlator located the national radio astronomy observatory socorro the correlator will combine and process data then make available mission investigators moscow tokyo and jpl via electronic mail smith optimistic that the massive radio telescope created the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before ground based radio telescopes allowing astronomers take closer look distant objects space there long history radio astronomy using ground based telescopes said smith what intend extend radio astronomy into earth orbit our goal look deeper into the cores galactic nuclei quasars and other active radio sources understand what drives those things have seen far with radio astronomy smith noted that one examines the active galactic nuclei you find jets appearing spew speeds greater than light and energy levels that are millions times greater than you would expect said some astronomers believe that black holes may located the cores these galaxies and that they may fuel the jets smith hopes that using space vlbi look further into the cores this theory may supported disproved russian space flight hardware including transponders and transmitters are now being tested the united states and japanese hardware scheduled arrive for testing later this year analysis this hardware will permit scientists and engineers understand how modify the high speed vlba correlator operating the nrao order accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than ground based radio telescopes involved space vlbi smith particularly pleased that meetings with the japanese and russian space agency officials like those held jpl march have proceeded smoothly yet knows that the political uncertainty russia could jeopardize that country participation the project nothing ever smooth said but the russians have been incredibly open with always anticipated some likelihood that will not succeed because political factors beyond our control yet there tends way keeping these things going because scientists both sides are trying hard and people recognize the value cooperation this level smith points out that the japanese space agency has more stake than just fulfilling international commitment science mission the japanese have been extremely cooperative since international cooperation essential their science mission said but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials look the space vlbi mission opportunity showcase the technology involved with vsop spacecraft and their highly regarded mach launch vehicle yet regardless the risks involved undertaking such ambitious project jpl smith satisfied that planning for the space vlbi project beyond the significant financial and political

errors are mine permission granted copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif operations rimsat was invited speak informal lunch held acdis here the campus the university illinois acdis organization campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat was considered appropriate topic because the company using russian launchers and satellites think also helped that his daughter grad student the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went tonga visit friend while was there somehow ended visiting the king who happened big fan matt bought the king satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has gnp about million his majesty asked there was any way make money off this matt thought there probably was his suggestion tonga applied for geosynchronous satellite slots while this isn entirely off the wall was very unusual seeing tonga was tiny kingdom with space program and lot slots the whole thing was debated the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who apparently respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga case eventually tonga ended with slots ranging from slots are designated the longitude over which they reside according sternberg four these from are the best the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed use these slots was officially formed nevis tax haven they tried for few years raise funds the west however fill slots with western satellites launched western launchers would have cost approximately billion not easy raise that kind money eventually they hit upon the idea using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware sternberg describes operating moscow such harsh terms that don think visit there for long time besides significant lack creature comforts was not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority sell what ever you want eventually rimsat arranged deal with glavkosmos for satellites cost million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this because they were basically bunch kgb operatives who went trade shows and picked lots brochures since glavkosmos was out power had renegotiate the deal with the new authorities again described life moscow hotel rather unfavorable terms eventually worked out deal and dec met with koptev who heads the russian space program sign the deal koptev insisted few concessions before signing and according sternberg arranged these new rules allow himself form another company the exact same thing rimsat the next step was meet with the builders the hardware npo applied mechanics npo use their acronym this organization located siberia can figure out how spell the town need atlas and has built about vehicles since the dawn the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers honest people who team get things done very much like midwesterners this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots good things say about npo his company apparently lookng for million invest the firm become partners apparently costs the russians about million build satellite that would sell for million the west you want give them specifications they build you satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will using costs run about per transponder year this compares the they can sell their time for about million compared million the rimsat will launch their satellites protons get the best prices they bought bulk they have the rights twelve launches any you need lift can give you their address the first launch scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind thing has done entrepreneurs not big business because big business just like what they have over there except that have better paper both the bathroom and the copier russian launches are self insured the promise replace failed launch within months major investors rimsat include russell which huge retirement fund organization cellsat which big telecom business southeast asia and fund operated some the big names aerospace which says sort insurance policy for them this really takes off downplayed the instabilites the ussr saying that are worried partly because aren used seeing russia anything but unvarying monolith italy gets new government every two weeks but don worry because used predicted that once get used seeing what really goes russia won worry about their stability much part the problem with cooperative ventures the problem transfering money the central bank has policy taking hard currency payments putting their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value rubles get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into austrian bank account npo then pays their contractors with foreign currency that the only the contractors get swindled the government one the big problems rimsat has had stonewalling the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three the same type satellites which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellites have lifetime about years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about years while this much shorter than years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the difference these prices they can afford launch new ones addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology they will able

articles commercial space sales flatten the department commerce projects commercial space sales will remain flat with current data showing only percent growth over published industrial outlook which was released january revenues from the space business are currently projected about contrast previous years when commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates this year projected results are driven the satellite manufacturing industry where sales are projected drop from satellites worth satellites worth the industrial outlook also projects commercial launchers faces flat demand coming year and while predicting that revenues will increase percent future sales will adversely affected the downward revision department defense launch plans offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected increase primarily driven increased revenues from broadcast and cable networks similarly remote sensing products and sales are projected increase commercial space revenues commercial satellites satellite services fixed mobile satellite ground equip mobile equipment commercial launches remote sensing data and services private microgravity research lab total annual revenues revised data for estimated data for commentary this the first look how the commercial space industry expected general not bad report with most the bad news concentrated the satellite manufacturing area there changes only few satellites worth apiece can substantially influence the annual projection look forward over several years this market sector should retain strong sales firms have been very successful regaining international market share the satellite business furthermore sales satellite ground equipment should the next revision this data expected released about mid year data mobile satellite ground equipment sales including such items gps receivers and portable satellite terminals appears missing from the january data set doc usually publishes listing space business indicators mid year and the next revision commercial space revenues should released then expect the revised revenues should easily top the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers and the year should show about overall market growth looking beyond this year data future markets look quite promising the doc projects satellite service revenues could top new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented planned and that mobile satellite station sales are expected continue growth per year through the mid numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but agree the trend should for substantial growth commercial space sales over least the next years pessimism due more conservative assumptions market capture and growth leo communications and satellite direct broadcasting services don believe all the current players the yet born leo communications satellite market and the yet proven direct broadcasting market will financial successes nor that sales growth will explosive currently projected should also noted this year doc data the first release show revenues from privately funded

from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module delta wins two key launch contracts mcdonnell douglas corporation which builds and markets the delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts motorola inc announced mid february that had selected the delta launch most the satellites the satellite iridium leo communications constellation and mid april mcdonnell douglas was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch for launch least iridium satellites another satellites have been contracted launched khrunichev enterprise russian proton vehicle launches these satellites planned for the delta will launched time providing for least launches additional satellites the iridium constellation such planned orbit spares may also launched delta although details the launch services contract were reported negotiation and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also went mdc bidding variant their delta launcher this contract only initially worth million but establishes set launch options for launches encompassing launches from through these launches will deploy the next generation the usaf global positioning system block iir navigation satellites plus other programs first option for meet the usaf launch options expected exercised this year after which the usaf expected request launches deltas per year for least years under this contract the usaf can also request launch demand services from mdc for the time period with launch occur within days the request commentary these two contracts are fulfilled they should provide excellent business base for mdc delta launch program through the turn the century combined these two contracts have potential for about launches worth about mdc and sustaining core business base year other contracts for international and commercial payloads well for nasa medium elv class payloads will add this business base keeping mdc viable commerical launch company however should noted there are risk elements these contracts motorola iridium leo communications constellation has not yet received federal communications commission license for operation the nor has motorola lined all the financing and financial partners for the iridium venture without these approvals financial backing there will iridium launches but hopefully these uncertainties will settled this year similarly the usaf mlv iii program has been the target several congressional actions which have slowed the production the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii program favor the usaf nls spacelifter program this time while appears the mlv iii contract will executed future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts being reconsidered part national space launch strategy reviews some opinions expressed from within the administration and congress propose cancellation all elv upgrade programs including the mlv programs favor the proposed spacelifter program such opinions may have some weight this year budget deliberations particularly dod funds will more difficult find the shrinking defense budget commercial remote sensing venture gets doc ahead the first commercial license operate remote sensing satellite was approved early february the department commerce office space commerce license was granted worldview imaging corporation oakland california build and operate pair leo imaging satellites provide multi spectral images the earth commentary there has been little data released this venture worldview and the doc other than the announcement the operating and construction license this was reported the request worldview most industry speculation identifies this new venture star wars spinoff using sdi type technology provide digital earth sensing data and heavily integrated into digital gis databases for remote sensing gis users most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists agricultural planners and urban planners noteworthy this the first commercial venture under the land remote sensing policy act the act passed last november provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may sold users differing prices prior this act remote sensing data from all satellites had sold all users the same prices and private remote sensing ventures would have had sell the government set landsat data prices there are rumors several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system different stages development think the large landsat and spot satellite systems will provide the majority the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade contrast these large government sponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures such worldview and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology and believe can find profitability the margin predict there may some very interesting ventures appearing the next year investment firm calls space biz still good investment wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general dynamic space systems division could still moneymaker despite having failed the last atlas launches recent analyst report morgan stanley said are more than ever convinced that the company can return the atlas its historical plus success rate this will become highly profitable cash generating unit based upon discussions with corporate management morgan stanley projects that the atlas problems are cleared the unit could see earnings per year and per year this based upon projection capturing about atlas launches per year the world market commentary three failures row their launch system has hurt general dynamic space systems division since has restructured only keep very few profitable core businesses many market pundits have been speculating space business might next sold the morgan stanley report indicates space systems division has some potential moneymaker despite current problems they can get their act together sales are projected about which will probably generate loss about can capture their projected share the space launch market and they have managed clean the reliability their atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits from those sales but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program back track this division will continue show substantial losses response the sell off rumors opinion this operation not really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability such takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would replaced with another set from outside the firm ssd case get the division back track the management team will have concentrate hard the technical problems with the atlas centaur well selling atlas services this would indicate only another firm with experience rocket launch operations could find such talent house and able convince customers buy their launch services optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience marketing space technology internationally well candidates for this might trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing but most those firms have cash flow problems mdc have had substantial business contraction boeing and mdc are involved with other launch firms lockheed have taken substantial debt martin and coming with the purchase price for the division big chunk change for any company ariane predicts dip launch demand arianespace the operator the ariane launch system projecting dip launch demand the late early february arianespace released their annual market survey which detailed their projection the space transportation market for the next decade over short run arianespace expects retain their dominant position and sustain majority share the launch market international and commercial launches planned through ariane holds contracts for general dynamics atlas vehicle holds contracts mcdonnell douglas delta holds and great wall long march vehicle holds launch contracts three quarters future launch contracts for which ariane can compete are projected come from communications satellites with the remaining split between weather earth observation and scientific satellites most the future telecommunications demand growth predicted come from the asia pacific region arianespace expects the current market consolidation individual satellite operators into regional national groups will continue with these groups investing heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders arianespace predicts the average mass telecommunications satellites should increase over today average level about geo demand for commercial launch services expected remain strong over the next three years but the second half the decade arianespace predicts demand will decrease arianespace bases this prediction upon matching satellite transponder demand and supply particularly new data compression techniques appear could double triple transponder capacity using existing near term transponders one the significant possible changes the market was identified the arrival new launch vehicles including russian launch systems but arianespace predicts that the long term investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch services will have prove out their capabilities and service quality and their market penetration will minimal commentary ariane releases their market surveys annually and reported their prior market survey past issue csn sti comparing the two surveys there aren outstanding differences the numbers the most notable change the consideration new data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical transponders orbit note that contrast some predictions demand for space based communications transponders appears remain strong while fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point point telecommunications markets growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point multipoint broadcast services have prevented decrease space transponder demand fiberoptic cables provide higher capability service but only from established point established point establish fiberoptic link necessary install cable between the points and while there are improved network solutions installing large network distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions billions dollars for broadcast services where there not existing ground network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective solution and new services are required into new region cheaper install small satellite link costing only few tens thousands dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network this allows rapid growth new satellite services and has kept demand high the replacement market for fiberoptics growing well since demand grows between the points serviced becomes cost effective later install fiberoptic link handle the increase traffic since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy but satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes current generation satellites are now getting guarantees years orbit service more contrast years service from last generation satellites this has cut back some the launch demand satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals and last note arianespace didn flag this year but looks like the space transportation market will rather over supplied existing launch systems the near term the annual commercial launch demand for about medium sized satellites per year from the supply side ariane capable launching about dozen medium sized satellites year delta capable about per year atlas capable long march japan vehicle russia proton capable and other systems such zenit and soyuz another medium launches per year that lot capability for small market can only expect the competition intensify for commercial launches ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the feb pegasus launch orbital sciences corporation has spawned investigation over apparent violation range safety rules valid abort order from nasa range safety officer halt the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched violation range safety rules the last few minutes the pegasus launch countdown one two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed such failure typically scrubs launch and nasa range safety officer wallops island issued mission abort order about minute before the scheduled pegasus launch somehow this command was overridden the osc launch team the message was lost the communications channels and the pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call fortunately the pegasus functioned expected and the abort command receiver was not needed but this incident did spark investigation since valid abort order was given under agreed launch constraint rules and was not obeyed leading the investigation the national transportation safety board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force this investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead incident involving space launch according the ntsb their investigation will take about months and primarily looking lines authority communications links and safety procedures used the launch commentary this the first time that the ntsb has led investigation into space launch their leadership was requested the department commerce office commercial space transportation who had licensed the commercial launch the time writing this column some the initial investigations have been concluded and some the results are starting leak out into the trade press apparently four different communications channels were use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the nasa test director and range controller the mission control room wallops island gave abort orders about minute before the launch according the mission rules this should have stopped the launch somehow the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the nasa communicator the net relayed that order the carrying the pegasus about seconds before launch differing explainations exactly how this happened are proposed with the best set being that clear lines communications and clear definition the responsibilities the mission control team and understanding the mission rules were not established before the launch see more and more commercial launches more these procedural issues are going crop and will have resolved this case interesting because the first time the ntsb has been called investigate commercial launch problem they with commercial aircraft problems think this problem will turn out primarily problems with procedures and communications and will cleared with issuance guidelines how launch communications should set and how specific lines authority should delineated another pegasus competitor announced tsniimach enterprise russia announced marketing new small space launch system based upon converted icbm components two versions the launcher are being marketed the aerokosmos winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus and the severkosmos launched from mobile ground transporter the aerokosmos projected deliver circular orbit circular orbit and the severkosmos capable orbits and also proposed used with these launch systems leo data relay system called sineva tsniimach enterprise described military establishment focusing aerodynamics and thermal protection spacecraft and which has participated the development the buran shuttle system they are located near the npo energia facility kaliningrad outside moscow commentary there very little released information this new venture suspicion another russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying capitalize upon their house knowledge soviet launch systems adds the list numerous commercial space startups announced from the soviet union this one little different that they are offering variants soviet icbms but can identify any key customers being targeted substantial financial backing georgia launch site dropped from planning late january georgia tech research institute released the results preliminary study the feasibility commercial rocket launching site camden county georgia the old kingsland missile test launching site the atlantic coast the preliminary study recommended the site not pursued commercial launch site stating reopening the site was not feasible due projected low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic considerations however the report did say the site might ideal for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses commentary this should put the nails the coffin the kingsland commercial launch site while other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans kingsland found without key customer act anchor tenant and substantial infrastructure had put then the expected returns were too low justify the cost development this might point out some key discriminators judging the feasibility commercial launch site these include there identified key customer provide core usage sufficient recover setup costs there market advantage using the site can existing infrastructure used modified the site can financing found low enough cost support the investment other commercial launch site ventures including those woomera poker flat cape york white sands alabama off shore platform hawaii and vandenberg have also judged against these criteria opinion some these ventures are flying hope and speculation and not sound financial grounds spain capricornia launcher still proceeding one his last official

tokyo first round investor and sits the board directors pacastro has gotten first round financial package least some sources place this high but has been searching for about year for the additional needed design build and launch their first set vehicles the launch reservation from ssc can possibly used help bring some investors board but estimate they will need much more than the single sale put their venture into real hardware china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported early march was reported joint satellite communications venture between taiwanese and mainland chinese was the works reported the taipei press china development corp cdc headquartered taiwam and with links the ruling nationalist party planning set joint venture hong kong with china great wall industry corp with the objective launching regional communications satellite cdc would cover about the satellite system cost exchange for rights the satellite communications channels commentary this announcement came close the heels the release taiwanese plans for space development released mid january those plans the national space program office taiwan will launch satellites starting with rocsat scientific spacecraft planned for launch two additional satellites are planned both communications satellites trw has been helping taiwan plan this program budgeted through haven been able establish any relationship between this venture and those the nspot but there might connection while taiwan has the financing pursue several ventures the current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures the reported name for the tiawanese chinese system asiasat but don thinks this has any relationship with the existing hong kong based asiasat program involving chinese hong kong and other asian investors other than using organizational model there are some obvious advantages pursuing such joing venture could provide excellent first hand experience taiwan for very low cost which then can used later satellite ventures but there are internal political issues between taiwanese and chinese ventures but putting any joint venture through hong kong intermediary corporation might allow proceed any case the east asian satellite market lighting with substantially growth projected space services and revenues this just another indicator add the list south korea

sci.space	space advertising two developments have brought these type activities back the forefront first february the russians deployed reflector from progress vehicle after had departed from the mir space station while this banner reflector was blank npo energia was very active reporting that future banner reflectors will available advertisers who could use space based video their logo printed the banner commercial filmed from the mir the second development has been that space marketing inc the same company responsible for merchandising space the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft now pushing the environmental billboard laid out smi chief engineer ron humble the university colorado space laboratory and preston carter the lawrence livermore national laboratory the environmental billboard large inflatable outer support structure meters advertising carried mylar reflective area deployed the inflatable frame help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard orbit will carry ozone reading sensors continuously monitor the condition the earth delicate protective ozone layer according mike lawson head smi furthermore the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure days will released enter the earth atmosphere according imi the biodegradable material burns will release ozone building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before too enters and burns and adds the ozone supply this would not cheap advertisement costing least several millions dollars exact costs were not available but smi estimates that market exposure would that the people who watched the superbowl where second advertising unit cost since smi located atlanta georgia being promoted being available time for the opening the summer olympics atlanta but back brian questions and does anyone have any more details other than what was the news blip how serious this project this just the wild idea stage does have real funding see above for serious they can get estimate for development costs and flight unit plus for launch then probably real they are claiming tailor the orbit overfly specific locations specific times for optimum advertising impact they probably can piggy back upon someone else planned launch and will have buy dedicated launch that cost they need raise right there and there will probably some legal challenges this well note there one potential legal challenge smi the use launch vehicle advertising already while don think the legal challenges would win out and yes amateur astronomer and don really like the idea this additional light pollution but know prohibition the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects the advertising can imagine several ways make the advertisers look like louts for doing this which would change positive market exposure negative market exposure and negate the space advertising advantage would you spend look like idiot and light pollution might not too bad low enough orbit and relies upon reflected light only would only visible for short time just after local dusk and before dawn for maximum market exposure you want have visible just after dusk minimizing impact astronomy since that the time worse seeing due day night thermal turbulence might still problem but perhaps there are ways mitigate this for having real funding none that can identify there were about expressions interest made the conestoga advertising opportunity but that included curious folks and was for only commitment haven heard any serious funding for this but sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money order flesh out the concept some more but confident there are firm paying customers this time and anybody wants cross post this sci astro please guest don have posting privileges that area least don think wales larrison space technology investor maximus

sci.space	larsonian astronomy and physics larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists claim looking for unified field theory which all the forces the universe can explained with single set laws equations but they have been systematically ignoring suppressing excellent one for years the late physicist dewey larson comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe which calls the reciprocal system built two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures space and time the physical universe composed entirely one component motion existing three dimensions discrete units and two reciprocal forms space and time the physical universe conforms the relations ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry euclidean from these two postulates larson developed complete theoretical universe using various combinations translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motions the concepts ward and out ward scalar motions and speeds relation the speed light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum each step the development larson was able match objects his theoretical universe with objects the real physical universe photons sub atomic particles incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet discovered then such exploding galaxies and gamma ray bursts and applying his theory his new model the atom larson was able precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances crystals and molecules compressibility and thermal expansion solids and other properties matter all this described good detail with out fancy complex mathematics his books books dewey larson the following complete list the late physicist dewey larson books about his comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe some the early books are out print now but still available through inter library loan the structure the physical universe the case against the nuclear atom beyond newton new light space and time quasars and pulsars nothing but motion substitute for the billion super collider the last four chapters explain chemical bonding the neglected facts science the universe motion final solutions most all astrophysical mysteries basic properties matter all but the last these books were published north pacific publishers box portland and should available via inter library loan your local university public library doesn have each them several them including the last one are available from the international society unified science isus atkin ave salt lake city utah this the organization that was started promote larson theory they have other related publications including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey larson background physicist dewey larson was retired engineer chemical electrical was about years old when died may had bachelor science degree engineering science from oregon state university developed his comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe while trying develop way compute chemical properties based only the elements used larson lack fancy degree might one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but not valid reason sometimes takes relative outsider clearly see the forest through the trees the same time clear from his books that also knew orthodox physics and astronomy well any physicist astronomer well enough point out all their contradictions hoc assumptions principles impotence consistencies etc larson did not have the funds etc experimentally test his theory and was not necessary for him simply compared the various parts his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data and many cases his explanation fit better self consistent theory much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have they claim looking for unified field theory that works but have been ignoring one for over years now modern physics does not explain the physical universe well some parts some larson books are full quotations leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree and remember that epicycles crystal spheres geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed explain well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank meyer professor emeritus superior was strong proponent larson theory and was still president larson organization the international society unified science and editor their quarterly journal reciprocity moved minneapolis after retiring super collider boondoggle against contruction the superconducting super collider texas anywhere else would gross waste money and contribute almost nothing scientific value most physicists don realize but according the comprehensive general unified theory the late physicist dewey larson described his books the strange goofy particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc which they are finding existing colliders fermi lab cern etc are really just atoms anti matter which are created the high energy colliding beams and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment larger and more expensive collider will only create few more elements anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before and the physicists will even more confused than they are now are few more types anti matter atoms worth the billion cost don have much more important uses for this wasted money another thing consider that the primary proposed location texas has serious and growing problem with some kind fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables how much poisoning the ground and ground water with insecticides will required keep the ants out the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon proposed totally absurd built should named after leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter larson comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe anti matter not simple case opposite charges the same types particles has more with the rates vibrations and rotations the photons which they are made relation the vibrational and rotational equivalents the speed light which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum larson theory positron actually particle matter not anti matter when positron and electron meet the rotational vibrations charges and rotations their respective photons which they are made neutralize each other larson theory the anti matter half the physical universe has three dimensions time and only one dimension space and exists reciprocal relationship our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point the orbit the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured advance the rate seconds arc per century seconds this advance are attributed via calculations gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter etc the remaining seconds arc are being used help prove einstein general theory relativity but the late physicist dewey larson achieved results closer the seconds than general relativity can instead using special relativity one more his books applied the lorentz transformation the high orbital speed mercury larson totally rejected general relativity another mathematical fantasy also rejected most special relativity including the parts about mass increases near the speed light and the use the lorentz transform doppler shifts those quasars with red shifts greater than really are moving faster than the speed light although most that motion away from time larson comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe there are three dimensions time instead only one but two those dimensions can not measured from our material half the physical universe the one dimension that can measure the clock time low relative speeds the values the other two dimensions are negligible but high speeds they become significant and the lorentz transformation must used fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this regard mass increases has been proven atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed light but the formula for acceleration acceleration force mass orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force larson theory mass stays constant and force drops toward zero force actually motion combinations motions relations between motions including inward and outward scalar motions the expansion the universe for example outward scalar motion inherent the universe and not result the called big bang which yet another mathematical fantasy the universe motion wish recommend everyone the book the universe motion dewey larson north pacific publishers box portland oregon pages indexed hardcover contains the astrophysical portions general unified theory the physical universe developed that author unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago contains final solutions most all astrophysical mysteries including the formation galaxies binary and multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin the degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts and the true nature quasars pulsars white dwarfs exploding galaxies etc contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for they are ready seriously consider with open minds the following example his theory success his first book the structure the physical universe larson predicted the existence exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are necessary consequence larson comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered had immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they were originally thought originate from neutron stars the disc our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now earth orbit has been detecting them all directions uniformly and their source locations space not correspond any known objects except for few cases directional coincidence gamma ray bursts are necessary consequence the general unified theory the physical universe developed the late physicist dewey larson according page his book the universe motion published the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions the anti matter half the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because the relationship between the anti matter and material halves the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere space seemingly random this why the source locations the bursts not correspond with known objects and come from all directions uniformly wonder how close space source location would have for gamma ray burst kill all most life earth there would way predict one nor stop perhaps some the mass extinctions the past which are now being blamed impacts comets and asteroids were actually caused nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half all the stars the galaxy the vicinity the sun are binary double but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have satisfactory theory about how they form why there are many them but binary star systems are actually likely consequence the comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe developed the late physicist dewey larson will try summarize larsons explanation which detailed chapter his book the universe motion and some his other books first all according larson stars not generate energy fusion small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse the rest results from the complete annihilation heavy elements heavier than iron each element has destructive temperature limit the heavier the element the lower this limit star internal temperature increases grows mass via accretion and absorption the decay products cosmic rays gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit lighter and lighter elements when the internal temperature the star reaches the destructive temperature limit iron there type supernova explosion this because there much iron present and that related the structure iron atoms and the atom building process which larson explains some his books better than can when the star explodes the lighter material the outer portion the star blown outward space less than the speed light the heavier material the center portion the star was already bouncing around close the speed light because the high temperature the explosion pushes that material over the speed light and expands outward time which equivalent inward space and often actually disappears for while over long periods time both masses start fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward space now starts form red giant star the material that had been blown outward time starts form white dwarf star both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions the diagram the chances the two masses falling back into the exact same location space making single lone star again are near zero they will instead form binary system orbiting each other according larson white dwarf star has inverse density gradient densest its surface because the material its center most widely dispersed blown outward time this eliminates the need resort mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron stars black holes etc larsonian solar system formation the mass the heavy material the center the exploding star relatively small then instead single white dwarf star there will several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away three dimensional time affected its heat etc these will become planets chapter the universe motion larson used all this information and other principles his comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe derive his own version bode law black hole fantasy heard that physicist stephen hawking recently completed theoretical mathematical analysis two black holes merging together into single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum the two original black holes such result should recognized everyone red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea black holes etc after reading physicist dewey larson books about his comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe especially his book the universe motion clear that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object cygnus just unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists badly want prove their theory the way not understand why much publicity being given physicist stephen hawking the physicists and astronomers seem acting hawking severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser does not wish the same attention had been given physicist dewey larson while was still alive widespread publicity and attention should now given larson theory books and organization the international society unified science electro magnetic propulsion heard that concept many years ago connection with ufo and unorthodox inventors but never was able find out how why they work how they are constructed found possible clue about why they might work pages the book basic properties matter the late physicist dewey larson which describes part larson comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe quote one paragraph indicated the preceding chapter the development the theory the universe motion arrives totally different concept the nature electrical resistance the electrons find are derived from the environment was brought out volume larson book nothing but motion that there are physical processes operation which produce electrons substantial quantities and that although the motions that constitute these electrons are many cases absorbed atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type motion such structures are limited follows that there always large excess free electrons the material sector material half the universe most which are uncharged this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect extension space because they are inherently rotating units space and the relation space space not motion open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently the same location with respect the natural reference system the manner photon the context the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon carried outward the speed light the progression the natural reference system all material aggregates are thus exposed flux electrons similar the continual bombardment photons radiation meanwhile there are other processes discussed later whereby electrons are returned the environment the electron population material aggregate such the earth therefore stabilizes equilibrium level note that larson theory uncharged electrons are also massless and are basically photons light particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity the speed light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents the speed light according larson theory might have the above and below labels mixed larson saying that outer space filled with mass less charged electrons flying around the speed light this true then the electro magnetic propulsion fields spacecraft might able interact with these electrons other particles space perhaps giving them charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear achieve propulsion larson theory electrical charge one dimensional rotational vibration particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed the rotation the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give clue confused meteorologists about how and why lightning generated clouds suppression larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory the physical universe developed the late physicist dewey larson has been available for more than years published his first book the structure the physical universe totally scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priests the religion they call science physics astronomy etc well the scientific literature and the education systems totally ignore larson theory has they have larson theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such gamma ray bursts and the nature quasars larson theory deserves honestly and openly discussed the physics chemistry and astronomy journals the and elsewhere and least the basic principles larson theory should included all related courses madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere that students are not kept the dark about worthy alternative the dogma they are being fed for more information answers your questions etc please consult cited sources especially larson books altered reproduction and dissemination this important
