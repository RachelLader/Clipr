sci.med	re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy heart access digex com g writes hi i ve just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y all can help me with i ve been seeing her every weeks for the past few months i m at week and during the last visits i ve gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands i ve thus far gained pounds also she says that though i m at weeks the baby s size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the baby s size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i ve had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that s of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasn t eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i m not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she s concerned about fat i m not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i can t seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and she s taken it all off and hasn t had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i m being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet since i m trying that anyway even if she said really low fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i m not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i m truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i ll end up having to eat constantly thus far i don t find any foods satisfying thanks g for one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if it changes anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat it s hard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is the baby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs how tight are your clothes you shouldn t be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive easier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months when you are shortwaisted it s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had my second one to do over again i think i d have tried to loosen up since he didn t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way especially if she s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little trouble some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here good luck jackie

sci.med	re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy aldridge netcom com jacquelin aldridge writes i decided to come back and amend this so it quotes me and has added comments heart access digex com g writes hi it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if g for one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if it changes anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your non fat calories where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat it s hard to digest anyway first even fish fowl and breads have fat second the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them third your body like most peoples wasn t bred to live on a high fat modern diet if you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about the luxury of eating fat how people enjoyed it this was because it was so rare even cows didn t put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that they do now for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is the baby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs how tight are your clothes you shouldn t be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive easier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months when you are shortwaisted it s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had my second one to do over again i think i d have tried to loosen up since he didn t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way especially if she s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible you don t want to become ill with it while you are pregnant if you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the baby it is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest of the population a good part of it is that they are willing to do the dieting etc that helps them avoid surgery also i don t think the surgery lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little trouble some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here good luck jackie
sci.med	re is msg sensitivity superstition these are my last words on the subject from lundby rtsg mot com walter f lundby writes as a person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are too i want to know why the food industry wants to put msg in food some people think it enhances the flavor i personally don t think it helps the taste it makes me sick so i try to avoid it from dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes sez you such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they re not relevant to the matter at hand which is not to say that i favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the additive but we have no reason to believe that msg in the diet effects humans adversely well i know that msg effects me adversely maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff from kiran village com kiran wagle writes if you don t like additives then for godsake get off the net and learn to cook from scratch sheesh excuse me why can t people learn to cook from scratch on the net i ve gotten lots of recipes off the net that don t use additives if you like additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipes are not very good or the food is poor quality yes and you buy it says something about your taste eh i don t and what happens when the companies forced to submit to your silly notions go out of business because nobody wants to buy their overpriced bad food removing preservatives directly raises food costs by reducing shelf life hey i ll pay my hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways from kiran village com kiran wagle you have a good point msg is commonly used in soups in bottled sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potato chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fish and chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the problem we should call this barbecue potato chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavorings syndrome it s been a few years since i ve bought anything labelled with and other natural flavorings from kiran village com kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg was in the food that was the only difference same restaurant same ingredients how do you know this in order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise the preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lied about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil and produced some bizarre toxin that you re allergic to well i had had similar reactions many times that was when i really started watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what s in there reaction to lawry s season salt guess what s in there i ll give you a hint i ve had enough problems with many many many different products with msg that i figured out one thing unless i plan on getting sick i won t eat the stuff without my seldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am just trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and every time i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food products and consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most importantly it s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incredibly frugal fiance didn t flinch when i literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when there s waste but it was a simple explanation i won t eat this stuff i won t cook with this stuff so i can either throw it out or give it away from pattee ucsu colorado edu donna pattee my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msg probably lawry s seasoning salt i love the way that tastes i m not saying i never consume anything with msg i ve noticed that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips will bother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurants the day before from kelley healthy uwaterloo ca catherine l kelley all that s needed now is that final step a double blind study done on humans there isn t even an ethical question about possible harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive but some say that only of the population has a problem with msg some say it s more like but let s say that it s how many people would have to be tested that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunteer for a test like thanks guys but i don t want to get sick also i m sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times if i have a cold i m much more susceptible to the reaction than when i m healthy as proven today when i m stuffy but for some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbq chips from kiran village com kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical you not you cathy go around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to the people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese food thats why i suggested calling this diner syndrome cathy doesn t i haven t saved all my postings but i never called it chinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only from chinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold or not hold the msg i can t call up whoever makes doritos and ask them to make me one back of chips without msg on the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix or restaurant spice mixes i m going to believe them and if anyone says they got msg sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party i m really going to believe them well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier post let s see you wrote this message at date apr but on date apr gmt i wrote has anyone had an msg reaction from something other than a chinese restaurant lots of times that s why it was so hard for me to pin down i would probably have been easier if i d only have the reaction in a certain type of restaurant but i ve had the reaction in chinese restaurants and greek restaurants and italian restaurants and steak places i can tell you when a steak joint uses accent to tenderize their meat oh and just in case anyone thinks i m prejudice against either chinese food or asian people i m not going home to cook some chinese food for the guy i m marrying next week incidentally his last name is wu so stop it with the flame mail why does a woman work ten years to

sci.med	perception of doctors and health care the following article by columnist mike royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public s perception of doctors and their salaries i hope some of you will find it as amusing as i did reprinted w o permission there s no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors salaries by mike royko tribune media services on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors earnings is right up there it almost scored a perfect brain dead it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called families usa the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians those polled said oh about a year would be ok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns plus and get the same results since the majority of americans don t make those bucks they assume that those who do are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but don t kid yourself karl marx lives it s also stupid because it didn t ask key questions such as do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician if those polled said no they didn t know then they should have been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers they should have been dropped what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don t know what it takes to become a doctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a average or better and c spend four more years of grinding study in medical school with the third and fourth years in clinical training working to hours a week and d spend another year as a low pay hard work intern and e put in another three to years of post graduate training depending on your specialty and f maybe wind up in debt after medical school and g then work an average of hours a week with many family doctors putting in hours or more until they retire or fall over as you have probably guessed by now i have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake america s health care based on what doctors contribute to society they are far more useful than the power happy ego tripping program spewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clinton s first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the stupid poll indicates many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs of course doctors are well compensated they should be americans now live longer than ever but who is responsible for our longevity lawyers congress or the guy flipping burgers in a mcdonald s and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self indulgent lard butted tv gaping couch cabbages ah that is not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain they might have been more honest if they had said let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have that problem is you my fellow american yes you eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of you guzzling too much hooch still puffing away at a pack getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure you and your habits not the doctors are the single biggest health problem in this country if anything it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do in fact i don t understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day so as your president i call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly now i must go get myself a triple cheesy greasy with double fries do as i say not as i do but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid there is another solution don t use them that s right you don t feel well then try one of those spine poppers needle twirlers or have rev bubba lay his hands upon your head and

worldwide aids statistics hicnet medical newsletter page i volume number april centers for disease control and prevention mmwr rates of cesarean delivery united states source mmwr date apr cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly million of the approximately million annual deliveries in the united states since table the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico this report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdc s national hospital discharge survey nhds for and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from short stay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since in the nhds conducted by cdc s national center for health statistics for medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of inpatients discharged from participating hospitals the cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the nhds sample of approximately women discharged after delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from national vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the nhds stated differences in this analysis are significant at the confidence level based on the two tailed t test with a critical value of in there were cesareans per deliveries the same rate as in and similar to rates during table the primary cesarean rate i e number of first cesareans per deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans for also was stable ranging from to in the cesarean rate in the south was significantly p higher than the rates for the west midwest and northeast rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to years than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than beds than in larger hospitals and for deliveries for which blue cross blue shield and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment table the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early s the number and percentage of births to older women increased however if the age distribution of mothers in had remained the same as in the overall cesarean rate in would have been essentially the same as the observed based on the nhds of the approximately live births in an hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april estimated were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated births were repeat cesareans and were primary cesareans since approximately primary cesareans have been performed annually in of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with in of all cesareans in were associated with a previous cesarean with dystocia i e failure of labor to progress with breech presentation with fetal distress and with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in was days in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was days and for a repeat cesarean days nearly twice the duration for vbac deliveries days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs days in the average hospital stay for all deliveries was days for primary cesareans days for repeat cesareans days and for vbac and non vbac vaginal deliveries and days respectively reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center for health statistics cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from through however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries objective postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health care costs for example in the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were and respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes for physician fees and for hospital charges if the cesarean rate in had been the year objective instead of the number of cesarean births would have decreased by versus resulting in a savings of more than billion in physician fees and hospital charges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since several factors may impede progress toward the year national health objectives for cesarean delivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since of women who are offered a trial of labor could deliver vaginally a level already achieved by many hospitals trial of labor was routinely offered in of hospitals surveyed in the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national data are available when the vbac rate according to nhds data was the year objective specifies a vbac rate of based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peer review process other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician and hospital specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important

prevention of malaria in africa has become a challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance although the risk of acquiring malaria for u s citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and unpredictably during may the office of medical services department of state oms dos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official u s personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of the health records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june compared with two cases during the same period in ehu oms dos and cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among u s embassy personnel this report summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from of the reported case patients were available for review by oms dos and cdc a case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for plasmodium sp of the persons were slide confirmed as having malaria a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to obtain information about residence activities use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures i e using bednets and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening of the persons eligible for the survey responded risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in kampala although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to years than among persons greater than years this difference was not significant relative risk rr confidence interval ci eighty two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for years compared with those living there less than year travel outside of the kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine alone and proguanil alone in addition persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis the risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis rr ci twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april all or most of the time than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets rr ci the risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening compared with those who rarely used repellent rr upper confidence limit risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening as a result of this investigation ehu staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens ehu staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel reported by u s embassy health unit kampala uganda office of medical svcs dept of state washington d c malaria br div of parasitic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note in uganda the increase in malaria among u s personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub saharan africa the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria endemic areas preventive measures that are also important for short term travelers to such areas mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most other areas with chloroquine resistant p falciparum however in some areas e g thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness in africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with p falciparum is mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at mg per week over a

nidr research digest written by jody dove march national institute of dental research at the second international workshop on the oral manifestations of hiv infection held january february in san francisco participants explored issues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosal immunology and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection the workshop was organized by dr john greenspan and dr deborah greenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university of california san francisco an international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance the conference drew more than scientists from countries including asia africa europe central america south america as well as the united states and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the national institute of dental research the national cancer institute the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids research and the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision of oral care to the hiv positive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection and women s issues recommendations recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of hiv infection has hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april radically changed in hiv infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression and prognosis social political issues discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection focused on changing the public s attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed health care delivery for hiv infected patients and the need to educate the public about what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hiv inhibitory effect of saliva to the aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hiv infected children has tripled the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother s sero status is known prior to giving birth periodontal and gingival tissue disease hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy occupational and treatment issues occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv infected individuals and treatment rendered by hiv infected health care professionals still command considerable attention factors under consideration include the cost benefit of hiv testing patient to health care provider transmission of hiv infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of hiv infected patients conference participants

administration for immediate release susan cruzan the food and drug administration today announced the approval of depo provera an injectable contraceptive drug the drug which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection the hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy it is more than percent effective this drug presents another long term effective option for women to prevent pregnancy said fda commissioner david a kessler m d as an injectable given once every three months depo provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose depo provera is available in mg single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection if a patient decides to become pregnant she discontinues the injections as with any such products fda advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of depo provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it depo provera s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer the world health organization and health agencies in other countries u s clinical trials begun in also found depo provera effective as an injectable contraceptive the most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain in addition some patients may experience headache nervousness abdominal pain dizziness weakness or fatigue the drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding breast cancer or blood clots in the legs lungs or eyes the labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april recent data have also demonstrated that long term use may contribute to osteoporosis the manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect depo provera was developed in the s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries the upjohn company of kalamazoo mich which will market the drug under the name depo provera contraceptive injection first submitted it for approval in the united states in the s at that time animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer including breast cancer in humans to be minimal if any hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april new rules speed approval of drugs for life threatening illnesses p food and drug administration monica revelle the food and drug administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life threatening illnesses such as aids cancer and alzheimer s disease these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan m d the effort to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a long term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease are used the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established the drug s sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug s effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness one new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when fda determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight said fda commissioner david a kessler m d while drug approval will be accomplished faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify the drug s clinical benefit if there is new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of the drug or biologic hicnet

rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests baltimore md researchers at the university of california san francisco and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq regn have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light sensing cells in the retina of the eye the degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment this research published to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pnas holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists it is estimated that million americans have severe vision loss due to age related macular degeneration and americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes blindness in addition each year more than people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas the research was funded in part by the rp retinitis pigmentosa foundation fighting blindness regeneron pharmaceuticals and the national eye institute it was conducted by drs matthew m lavail kazuhiko unoki douglas yasurnura michael t matthes and roy h steinberg at ucsf arld dr c eorge yancoooulos regeneron s vice president for discovery regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from ucsf in the research described in the pnas a light damage model was used to assess the survival promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light exposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor ngf and insulin like growth factor igf were not effective in these experiments discussing the research dr jesse m cedarbaum regeneron s director of clinical research said bdnf s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age related macular degeneration one of the leading causes of vision impairment and for retinal detachment following detachment permanent vision loss may hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april result frorn the death of detached retinal cells it is possible that bdnf could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness it is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life stated jeanette s felix ph d director of science for the rp foundation fighting blindness in addition to the work described regeneron is developing bdnf in conjunction with aingen inc

dec national institutes of health high fat high calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according to investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past years dr connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the name tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of miles or more while kicking a machete carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food contains approximately percent of total calories as fat of which the majority percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of mg dl low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels of mg dl and high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels of to mg dl all of those values are in the good low risk range according to the researchers elevated cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april disease hdl cholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldl cholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for week followed by weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet csi indicates the diet s potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of dr connor s affluent diet used in the study ranks a csi of the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fat and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating on a plateau dr connor says after weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rose percent hdl cholesterol increased by per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceride levels increased by percent and subjects averaged an pound gain in weight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after days of affluent diet as after days hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations we think hdl cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to percent of the total calories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than percent of total calories as fat less than mg of cholesterol and a csi around varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a mediterranean style diet the original mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society s elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well being rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is percent less than it was years ago so a lot has been accomplished we are

procedure has been done by an infected health care worker a model letter to patients who have come into contact with such an individual is provided along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media in addition a u k advisory panel on hiv infection in health care workers has been formed to provide specific occupational recommendations to those treating such patients properties of an hiv vaccine nature vol no p volvovitz franklin and smith gale the questions raised by moore et al about recombinant gp envelope glycoprotein precursor from hiv produced by microgenesys are advantages rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd receptor and that this recombinant gp does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp in patients infected with hiv broadens hiv specific envelope directed immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp epitopes and cd and cd cytotoxic t cell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody responses against native hiv proteins including the types described by moore et al exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april progression of hiv disease in addition the binding of gp or gp antibody complexes to cd has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection the absence of cd binding by the microgenesys gp vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd counts stimulation of cytotoxic t cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other clinical results microgenesys gp was chosen by researchers at the karolinska institute in sweden for the first phase iii vaccine therapy studies conclude volvovitz and smith hiv infection breast milk

months of lactation to barely detectable levels lactoferrin and iga then increase from three to twelve months with percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in both normal and uninfected children born to hiv positive mothers the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv infected children had a longer median incubation time months than bottlefed infants months breastfed children also had a slower progression to aids there is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against hiv infection studies of the biological properties of milk from hiv infected women showed the presence of igg and iga antibodies against envelope glycoproteins as well as iga antibodies against core antigens binding of hiv to the cd receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor in the developing world where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality breast milk is still the best food for infants regardless of the mother s hiv status transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded the possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with hiv at birth and may even delay progression to aids concludes mok absence of hiv transmission from an infected dentist to his patients journal of the american medical association vol no p dickinson gordon m et al if universal precautions are practiced the risk of hiv transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal write gordon m dickinson hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april et al of the university of miami school of medicine in miami fla the researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with aids and attempts were made to contact all patients for hiv testing living patients with newly detected hiv infection were interviewed and dna sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of years were examined in detail there were patients who had undergone procedures of whom were deceased an examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with hiv infection all of whom were either homosexuals or iv drug users the researchers were able to detect of the remaining patients and agreed to be tested hiv infection was reported in five of the patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high risk behavior comparative dna sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related the study suggests the potential for hiv transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed conclude dickinson et al april aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb study says washington post p a tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control according to a study published in today s new england journal of medicine people who contract tb usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria again but a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new tb infection doctors found peter m small of the howard hughes medical institute at stanford university director of the study said that in order to protect against reinfection it may be necessary for some people to use tb medicines permanently the study examined the genetic makeup of tb bacteria and how the germs changed over time in patients at kings county

hypothesis that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically azt and psychologically positive aids test toxic public health initiatives writes peter duesberg of the university of california berkeley in the lancet s march issue schechter et al call duesberg s hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to aids a hindrance to public health initiatives however their hypothesis that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits the u s government spends billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no aids control have resulted from work on this hypothesis schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver however their survey neglects to disprove duesberg s drug aids hypothesis because it does not provide controls i e confirmed drug free aids cases and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt use altogether to refute duesberg s hypothesis schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to years hiv positive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same aids risks as positives who do not do so the year period is claimed by hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids alternatively they could show that hiv free individuals who have used drugs for years

autoimmune diseases in some settings may hasten cd t cell loss in some hiv infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions write sandro vento et al of the a pugliese hospital in catanzaro italy the researchers report three asymptomatic hiv infected individuals with hepatitis c virus related chronic active hepatitis cah who had a rapid profound decline of cd cells after ifn all three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum hiv p antigen and had circulating antibodies to p sera from all three patients obtained at the end of ifn treatment and testing in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii antigens homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of hiv gp these autoantibodies which also recognize native class ii molecules and may contribute to the elimination of cd t cells in vivo were at low tires in all three patients six months after stopping ifn such autoantibodies were not detected in other patients with hiv infection and hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not experience cd t cell loss in some hiv infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions the subjects had a b dr and b dr hla antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd cell counts and clinical progression of hiv disease ifn can induce a very rapid decline of cd cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these hla haplotypes the researchers conclude april tb makes a comeback state government news vol no p voit william and knapp elaine s although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the united states it is emerging again among the homeless aids patients immigrants minorities and prisoners dr lee b reichman professor of medicine at the university of new jersey medical school and president of the american lung association said right now it s a big city problem but potentially it s everyone s problem the ala predicts that million americans are infected with tb and about percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed especially those with aids or hiv gene hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april tammes a centers for disease control expert said that is why the cdc has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix aids with tb patients state health officials believe the tb is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment in addition the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services in new york city tb is an epidemic because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people said dr george diferdinando director of the new york state tb control according to diferdinando curbing the spread of tb entails keeping percent or more of diagnosed tb cases in treatment about percent of infected new york city residents don t complete therapy when tb patients don t finish taking their medication multi drug resistant tb can develop which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat increasing frequency of heterosexually transmitted aids in southern florida artifact or reality american journal of public health vol no p nwanyanwu okey c et al the alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired aids cases in southern florida was partially related to misclassification of risk write okey c nwanyanwu et al of the centers for disease control in atlanta ga the researchers investigated such aids cases from broward and coastal palm beach counties all of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men injecting drug users or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of hiv transmission medical records of patients in addition to records from social services hiv counseling and testing centers and sexually transmitted disease std clinics were reviewed if no other hiv risk factor was found from medical record review patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire once std clinic and other medical records were reviewed men and women were reclassified into other hiv transmission categories after adjustments were made for the reclassification the percentage of aids cases reported from palm beach and broward counties between january and march that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from percent to percent among men and from percent to percent among women while the percentage of heterosexually transmitted aids cases in southern florida decreased after

from an hiv positive surgeon to patient is extremely low provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of the dartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon n h the researchers contacted former patients on whom an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between january and june the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for hiv a total of former patients underwent hiv testing representing percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the year period patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure all patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study notifying patients of the infected surgeon s hiv status is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended the researchers conclude investigation of potential hiv transmission to the patients of an hiv infected surgeon journal of the american medical association vol hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april no p smith rogers audrey et al the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple methodologically similar investigations writes audrey smith rogers et al of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore md the researchers identified a total of persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between and and for whom the hiv positive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon the aids case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained among the patients were dead had no address had test results known and did not respond to the questionnaire no study patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newly detected hiv positive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in person hours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per person hours of surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection control guidelines over percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person was found to be infected with hiv the study patient s infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv positive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april drug concerns to share aids data new york times p c kolata gina a total of major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highly unusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway n j arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including act up dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease said we re delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for aids related stories wall street journal p b philadelphia inquirer p a usa today p b the next step in aids treatment nature vol no p maddox john although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with hiv the findings do not indicate that azt should not be administered in people with full blown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t cell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd counts of the people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of follow up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infected individuals and that cd cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and anti infective properties of breastmilk from hiv infected women lancet vol no p van de perre philippe et al a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm type in the mother s body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv from mother to child write philippe van de perre et al of the hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national aids control program in kigali rwanda the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of anti infective substances in breastmilk or both factors a total of hiv infected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali rwanda milk samples were collected days months and months post partum hiv igg secretory iga and igm were assayed by western blot for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g in the day and month samples the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers gag pol and env at days months and months post partum hiv specific igg was detected in percent percent and percent of breastmilk samples iga in percent percent and percent and igm in percent percent and percent in children who survived longer than months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hiv infected cells in the milk days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga anti hiv in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv the researchers conclude april firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce p a a total of fifteen u s and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early stage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug edward scolnick president of merck co research laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together said participants in addition to merck the other companies involved in the inter company collaboration for aids drug development are bristol myers squibb co burroughs wellcome glaxo inc hoffman la roche eli lilly co pfizer inc smithkline beecham ab astra du pont merck syntex inc boehringer ingelheim miles inc and sigma tau the participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively involved in hiv anti viral development may participate scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april and early clinical data the american foundation for aids research amfar was pleased with the news of the collaboration which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance related story financial times p guidance over hiv infected health care workers lancet vol no p horton richard the united kingdom s department of health recently followed the advice of aids experts that there is no scientific reason for routine hiv testing among health care workers following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted hiv the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases dr kenneth calman chief medical officer said doctors dentists nurses and other health care workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv infection including if appropriate diagnostic hiv testing he

sci.med	resound hearing aid theory as i understand it the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published in hearing instruments i would appreciate any comments about this and other new technology for hearing aids the resound system was developed on the basis of some research at at t and appears to take a different approach from other aids it appears to me that a new programmable aid like the widex just uses a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in noisy situations the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies while the important consonant information unfortunately for me is in the high frequencies the two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though i think the phrase is missleading what appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge this means that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to cps and then falls off a cliff aids with simple compressors don t descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor compress useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components particularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations rich haller rhaller ns uoregon edu university of oregon eugene or usa
sci.med	re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med dec p psychological tests results the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despite crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the

sci.med	pms can it be prevented by a diet change this question came up in sci med nutrition and i m posting my answer here only medical schools in the u s teach courses on human nutrition we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community i think that the best example of where u s medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms so many women and their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the u s are not taught that pms is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening before shooting your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified from a poster in sci medi nutrition in a psychological anthropology course i am taking we got sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms some rumors shared by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar intake and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey many thanks michael i ve wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i got side tracked with candida pms is a lot like candida blooms most physicians don t recognize it as a specific disease entity here is everything that you would ever want to know about pms premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups pmt a anxiety pmt d depression anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy pmt c craving pmt h hyperhydration craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness headache edema of the face and extremities palpitations fatigue or fainting pmt a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women s cycle pmt c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates during the luteal phase of a women s cycle there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt c are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e this condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia magnesium and pge seem to be specific to pms hypoglycemia a am j psychiatry unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation increased to of the total calories using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid pmt d is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the

treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for pms just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms while progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better there really has been an awful lot of research done on pms much more than candida blooms many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done here are a few of these studies carbohydrate experimental controlled study effect of a low fat high carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy lancet pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training after months there was a significant reduction

supplementation was stopped pms symptoms did not reoccur in any of these pts for upto one year after the vitamin a supplementation was stopped most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms of all the vitamins given for pms vitamin a b and vitamin e vitamin a has shown the best single effect this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid estrogen progesterone metabolism in the liver getting your liver full of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of pms but vitamin a is toxic and you don t want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin a

once they were switched to magnesium supplementation in addition the total score on the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation the authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during pms there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature but since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci med to be anecdotal in nature i have not bothered to cite them there are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms i ve chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder but doctors don t recognize nutritional disorders unless they can

sci.med	re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rhfrkinn shelley u washington edu nodrog hardy u washington edu gordon rubenfeld writes banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med dec p psychological tests results the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despite crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lost candida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen just like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections i m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene and a very important one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out of hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely like it is in animal husbandry marty b

efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lost point i m beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whole yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field which i m fully cognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for the situation in sci med many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large causing significant miscommunication one example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much more so than its meaning to a non doctor there is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non doctors come together on essentially equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan the flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really beat up by non doctors for their views on medicine which they otherwise don t see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient point i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well constructed clinical trials usually double blind or that such treatments therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice and it follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non therapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either from a treatment point of view and by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practice science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however as also being a human being last i checked and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlying intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when considering treatment what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post i outlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidence for patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted and not until then the patient would be fully informed that such therapies treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license or worse to non doctors who have not had the proper medical training this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way everybody wins in this admittedly rose colored approach i m sure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion hopefully what i write here may give the sci med doctors a better idea as to why i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have real difficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the pure scientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and by the scientific aspects anything else is just not good medicine imho just my nf leanings i guess

pose a major challenge for the nation s health care system federal health officials said thursday the centers for disease control and prevention reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in states and killed at least four said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases part of that emphasis includes a new series titled emerging infectious diseases to be featured in the cdc s morbidity mortality weekly report which has a wide circulation in the health community the issue also will top the agenda of a two day meeting of scientific counselors to update the cdc s draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments this is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it said dr ruth berkelman deputy director of the cdc s national center for infectious diseases there were more cases of malaria in the u s in than in any year since the s and latin america is experiencing a cholera epidemic the first in this century she said resistance of disease causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem we are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past berkleman said she said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states the cdc said it cited the emergence since the s of a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes such as escherichia coli o h a deadly bacterial infection the hepatitis c virus hiv the virus that causes aids legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis have increased in many areas the cdc said it said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance source wall street journal reference pb headline lyme disease ruling raises liability issues the tick that causes lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage legal liability a federal judge s decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease a flu like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death the decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property the decision by u s district judge robert j ward in new york came after a week long trial in a case involving four track workers for the long island railroad judge ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job he ordered the new york state owned commuter line to pay the workers more than to compensate for pain and suffering in addition to medical expenses and lost wages summer camps schools companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling says stephen l kass an attorney at new york law firm berle kass case who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable lawsuits for insect bites while rare aren t unheard of a summer vacationer in southampton n y last year sued the owner of the home she rented claiming that a tick on the property gave her rocky mountain spotted fever in also on long island a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than million to a patron who was stung by a bee causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia the judge later threw out the award citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant but lawyers say that the attention to lyme disease throughout the country it s most prevalent in new england the middle atlantic states wisconsin minnesota and the northwest may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one the illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease lawyers say worker s compensation claims related to lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years payments in worker s compensation cases however are limited to medical costs and lost earnings the case before judge ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages because it involved the question of negligence unlike the worker s compensation process the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and as a result for additional payments for pain and suffering property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease ira m maurer a partner at new york law firm elkind flynn maurer who represented the rail workers says the decision will help to establish the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against lyme disease lawyers caution that despite judge ward s decision winning a lawsuit for damages caused by lyme disease may prove difficult for one thing victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite judge ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad even though none of the men remembered being bitten the workers who weren t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites a spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal the railroad also disputes judge ward s finding that it didn t do enough to protect employees the spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites debate in the scientific community over lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness earlier this week the journal of the american medical association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having lyme disease and damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that lyme disease causes because of health and safety concerns some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against lyme disease last year at its headquarters in franklin lakes n j becton dickinson co began using damminix a pesticide made by ecohealth inc of boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease the medical supply company s headquarters include a acre park and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected ruth lister a spokeswoman for the american camping association in indianapolis says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks and carole katz a member of the board of the fire island pines property owners association says her group spends each year to treat their acre site off the coast of new york with the tick

sci.med	re help for kidney stones etxmow garbo ericsson se mats winberg writes isn t there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving a non invasive use of ultra sound where the patient is lowered into some sort of liquid when he she undergoes treatment i m sure i ve read about it somewhere if i remember it correctly it is a painless and effective treatment the use of shock waves not ultrasound to break up stones has been around for a few years depending on the type of machine and intensity of the shock waves it is usually uncomfortable enough to require something the high power machines cause enough pain to require general or regional anesthesia afterwards it feels like someone slugged you pretty good
sci.med	re resound hearing aids and others in article rhaller rhaller cc uoregon edu rhaller ns uoregon edu rich haller writes i have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss a recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to db down at cps then it falls off a cliff to dbs down from cps on this type of loss is difficult to fit i am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired recently i had an opportunity to test the widex q behind the ear aids for several weeks these have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed i found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called resound unfortunately i was only able to try the resound aids in their office for about minutes and i couldn t compare them head to head with the widex nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and i was impressed by what i was able to read about the theory behind them which i will give in a separate posting they also carry the widex aids and had one patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the resound even though he had purchased the widex only months ago the problem is that the resound aids are about twice as expensive as the widex and other programmable aids i could take a trip to europe on the difference being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money i am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the resounds i would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if i might see improvements in technology that aren t quite so expensive your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine thanks uncle sam i ve been wearing miracle ear canal aids for about months now and i find them to be acceptable they are molded to the shape of your ear canal and tuned to your hearing curve they are comfortable to wear and almost invisible if you re worried about that although if you re currently wearing behind the ear models that s not an issue the cost i paid each for mine through the miracle ear counter at sears i ve heard that there is a substantial discount for senior citizens but i haven t researched that because i m not a senior citizen yet give them a try you might be pleasantly surprised alan hepburn a man doesn t know what he knows national semiconductor until he knows what he doesn t know santa clara ca alan berlioz nsc com thomas carlyle
sci.med	re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rjifg bgm hsdndev harvard edu rind enterprise bih harvard edu david rind writes in article apr vms ocom okstate edu banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes oxygen just like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections i m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out i ve mentioned this study a couple of times now ingestion of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal vaginitis annals of internal medicine do you have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than capsules of lactobacillus even though it had positive results the study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of ounces of yogurt there was a marked decrease in infections while women were ingesting the yogurt problems with the study included very small numbers patients enrolled and many protocol violations only patients were analyzed still the difference in rates of infection between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly believable david rind david this study looks like a good one gordon rubenfeld did a medline search and also sent me the same reference through e mail since commercial yogurt does not always have a good lactobacillus a or bulgaricus culture a negative finding would not have been too informative this is often the reason why lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurt i guess the next question is why would this introduction of good bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not serving as a candida reservoir a fact that gordon r vehementy denys i see two possible theories one the l acidophilus which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida this would not explain the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though the other is that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida looses it s major food source getting lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract where it is normally found would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast blooms though an acetic acid lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but i ve not seen any such treatment reported in the medical literature this would be an example of physicians conducting their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their patients when this is done in private practice the results are rarely if ever published it was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerged with clinical trials it really raises a big question does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other way this particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involved even the anti fungals are not all that dangerous but there are some areas like edta chelation therapy where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned it s really tough do i follow only well established protocols and then give up if they don t work that well or do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn t been proven to work yet my stand is to consider other treatment possibilities especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient getting good bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility the other is getting l acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a problem with recurring yeast infections marty b
