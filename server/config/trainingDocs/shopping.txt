As I have talked about many times, I am a huge fan of trying to figure out the best times to make online purchases to maximize savings in terms of both deals and coupons made available by popular retailers. So I dug back through 8 years of data here at Rather-Be-Shopping.com and figured out when we get the best deals and coupons sent to us in December. I then broke the data up by product category and was able to decipher the exact day you should shop in order to get the best price between now and Christmas. Use this info as a helpful guide this year and I really believe you can save some significant money. Wednesday, December 16th: This date falls on a Wednesday this year. Last year we saw the absolute best prices and coupons for toys on December 16th.  This also included the number of deals and coupons available at stores like Toys R Us, Target, Amazon.com, and Walmart. The reason? This is when we reach crunch time for toy sales and the incentives begin to be thrown out by retailers in order to cash in on those “semi” last minute shoppers. Important Note: If your shopping list includes the hot toys of the year, like anything Star Wars related, you’re going to need to snatch those up when you find them and not wait until the 16th. Tuesday, December 15th: Our data the past five years shows excellent mid-month coupons from “specialty gift” online retailers like Red Envelope.com, Things Remembered, Personal Creations, and Shutterfly.com. They usually have new coupons starting on December 15th that last for at least a week. Shop early in that time period to ensure Christmas delivery. Friday, December 18th: Cyber Monday is always the best day of the year for online coupon codes at apparel and footwear retailers. Easily save 40-50% off. Not going to help you much now that we are in early December. So take advantage of the 2nd best day to save and shop online for clothing and shoes which is Friday, December 18th. This is also known as free shipping day, a day where hundreds of online retailers offer guaranteed Christmas Eve delivery at no extra charge. A large majority of online sites like Gap.com, Lands’ End.com, American Eagle, Macy’s, and Old Navy will have fantastic coupon codes to go along with their free shipping offer. A big double win. Shopping in-store? Be sure to shop on Sunday, December 20th for the best clothing and footwear deals. December 11th – 13th: So if you’re not buying a new TV for yourself, then you’ll want to wait until late January, early February, when new models are released and last season’s models have their prices severely slashed. But if you’re buying a TV as a gift, be sure to check out deals between December 11th and the 13th. Over the past 5 years in particular, we’ve seen some killer weekend deals 2 weeks out from Christmas from Best Buy.com, Costco.com, and Walmart.com. Look for deals this year in the 30-40% off range on Samsung, Sony, Vizio, and Panasonic. Wednesday, December 16th: Shopping for tools for Dad, Mom, or Grandpa this year? I had to throw Mom in there as my Mom is one of the handiest people I know when it comes to DIY projects and home repair/improvement projects. Take a look at the deals available online on December 16th. The last few years have seen some killer deals and price drops from Home Depot, Lowe’s, Ace Hardware, and Harbor Freight Tools. Also, shop in-store for tools and hardware from the 16th up to the 24th for some pretty darn good deals, easily in the 20-30% off range. Not shopping for tools as a Christmas gift idea? Then wait until after the holidays, several months actually, and shop for tools in the couple weeks leading up to Father’s Day. By far the best time of year to save on power tools, tool sets, and anything for the garage. Tuesday, December 15th: So for the past two years on December 15th, Dell.com and HP.com have hooked us up with some incredible online coupons. Like $500 off a top of the line Inspiron 15 laptop (the best price of the year) and also allowed shoppers to buy a very capable budget laptop for under $250. Look for the same this year. Also, check Costco.com for some attractive deals on laptops mid-December. Last year they offered several great deals on laptops from Dell, HP, Acer, and Toshiba. Not buying as a Christmas gift and can afford to wait? Wait until graduation season, followed by the back-to-school shopping season when we see our best prices of the year on a new laptop. No Set Date: The pricing on Apple products can be a bit tricky to figure out. We saw some pretty decent deals on Black Friday as the iPad, iPod, and iPad Mini all saw their lowest prices of the year with some pretty cool gift card incentives to boot. So what do you do if you didn’t take advantage? The best way to score a deal in December is to buy refurbished Apple products. Savings in the 20-40% off range on iMacs, iPads, iPods, and even the Apple TV. Worried about the quality of these refurb items? Don’t be. From the Apple Store site, refurbished items “undergo a rigorous refurbishment process to make sure it’s up to Apple’s tough quality standards. We back it with our standard one-year limited warranty.” December 14th – 17th: While Black Friday was a great day to buy video games and new gaming system bundles, fear not as you still have a chance to save money before Christmas. Every year over the past 8, we have seen some great deals from Gamestop.com, Amazon.com, Walmart, Target, and NewEgg.com in mid-December. In particular, between the 14th and 17th of the month, retailers really offer some attractive incentives to Christmas shoppers. We have seen new video game titles priced at 35% off the original price and older games at 60% off. Also, look for great deals on the XBox One and PS4 systems. Friday, December 18th: If you’re buying winter apparel as a Christmas gift, you’ll definitely want to shop online on December 18th. Not only will you get free shipping from hundreds of retailers as it’s Free Shipping Day, but many websites will also have coupon codes available to entice those last minute shoppers. Not buying for Christmas? Wait until the end of the winter season in March and take advantage of clearance sales on jackets, boots, sweaters, etc. December 4th – 25th: I have been informed by several jewelers that jewelry stores freeze their prices, independent of gold and silver prices, in the few weeks leading up to Christmas. So if you are window shopping for a wedding band now is a pretty darn good time to consider buying as prices could conceivable rise significantly after the holidays. The same goes for jewelry for your sweetie that you want to wrap and place under the tree. Thursday, December 10th: Last year we got new coupons for Sports Authority, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Modell’s, and Big 5 Sporting Goods on the 10th day of December. Will it happen again this year? I can’t guarantee it but I have already gotten word from a couple online sporting good stores that they’ll have some great coupons again in mid-December. Another good day is December 18th as Dick’s, Reebok Store, Under Armour, and Puma Store have already announced they will ship for free on that date. Not buying for Christmas? Shop right after the New Year when retailers offer great deals on fitness equipment and gear. Some of the best prices of the entire year. Friday, December 18th: December is always one of the best times to buy stuff for the kitchen. Stuff like cookware, dining sets, silverware, small appliances, and kitchen gear and decor. But exactly when in December is the best day to get an awesome deal? The answer is Friday, December 18th. Why? Because the following online retailers have already stated that they will ship items for free (with guaranteed Christmas Eve delivery) on that date: Pfaltzgraff, Belk, Mikasa, Brookstone, Lenox, and Chefs Corner Store. Look for even more stores to jump in as we get closer to the 18th. By Kyle James As most of you know, this upcoming Monday is known as Cyber Monday and it can be a killer way to save money when shopping online. But like any “shopping event” there are secrets to maximizing your savings. Here is what you need to know to make Cyber Monday a great day to save money on Christmas gifts this year. (See also: Our Cyber Monday Coupons) Ever wonder how the deals on Cyber Monday compare to some of the deals you can bag on Black Friday? Yeah, me too. So a few years ago I started hanging on to the Black Friday ads and comparing them to what I could find on Cyber Monday. I discovered some very interesting things…. Name Brand TV’s – Black Friday is a terrible day to score a deal on a name brand TV. All of the amazing door-buster deals are from 3rd tier manufacturers that you’ve never heard of. But this is not the case on Cyber Monday. The last couple Cyber Mondays in particular have seen some excellent deals on name brand TVs from Samsung, Sony, and Panasonic.  Last year we actually saw the lowest price of the year on a 46″ 1080p TV from Samsung for only $477.99 at Amazon. Look for more of the same this year from Amazon.com, Best Buy.com, Target.com, and Walmart.com. Laptop Computers – Budget laptops (ie, pieces of crap) are in full force on Black Friday. Systems that are OK for surfing the web, posting pictures of your cat on Facebook, and answering email, but that’s about it. If you need a laptop for running productivity software, video editing, or running multiple programs at once, you’ll want to shop for a higher quality laptop on Cyber Monday. Unlike Black Friday, they’ll be in full force. Check out this page from Staples.com that is already listing some really great Cyber Monday laptop deals. Tablets – Deals on tablets from brands like Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo are going to be good on Black Friday and that’s going to carry over to Cyber Monday. Be sure to look for deals. Gaming Systems – Cyber Monday is an excellent day to shop for both the popular XBox One and PlayStation 4. Last year on Cyber Monday at Walmart.com we saw the lowest price of the year on the PS4 system. Always look to bundle as that is where you’ll get the most savings. Bundles usually include the gaming system, an extra controller and a popular game. Christmas Toys – Christmas toys are typically never a good buy on Black Friday, and for the most part, the same can be said for Cyber Monday. Your best bet to find the lowest price is to shop the two weeks leading up to Christmas as that is when retailers start to feel the pinch and begin lowering prices. Home Goods – Target.com is a great stop on Cyber Monday for items for the house. Last year they had the lowest price of the year on a Dyson vacuum cleaner, Oster blender, and a KitchenAid mixer. I’m talking like close to 45% off the original price. Seriously. Best. Day. Ever. Over the past 5 Cyber Mondays I have been blown away with coupon codes we are given by apparel retailers. If you are shopping for apparel or shoes you need to check out the savings available on Cyber Monday. Last year we saw 30% or 40% off coupon codes from the following websites: American Eagle, Ann Taylor, Lands’ End, The Limited, Hot Topic, J.Jill, J.Crew, Macy’s, Nautica, Old Navy, GAP, Banana Republic, Wet Seal, and the list goes on and on. Also, be sure you know your size at individual retailers. What size jeans do you wear from Old Navy? What size sweater do you wear from Lands’ End? By knowing your sizes ahead of time, you’re going to avoid return costs if those skinny jeans won’t button. OK, so you shopped online on Cyber Monday last year and found some good deals and were pretty happy with yourself. Hold onto your horses. I guarantee you can get an even bigger deal this year by doing the following things… Hit Up Live Chat. About to buy online and can’t find a coupon code anywhere? Don’t pay full price, instead use my frugal hack of starting a live chat session and politely ask the operator for a coupon code for free shipping or a percent off. Operators are often given coupon codes to hand out if asked, especially on BIG shopping days like Cyber Monday. Abandon Cart Before Cyber Monday. Making a large purchase on Cyber Monday? Perhaps a TV from BestBuy.com or a new crib from Babies R Us.com. Consider my frugal hack of abandoning your virtual shopping cart a few days before Cyber Monday in an attempt to trigger a coupon sent via email. Find the instructions here as well as 17 popular online retailers where this will work. Black Friday Leftovers. Also try shopping on eBay on Cyber Monday. Why? Because countless “wannabe entrepreneurs” snatch up the Black Friday leftovers and put them up on eBay for a quick cash profit. But the good news for you is that with the saturated eBay market you’re going to score a deal and end up paying only slightly more than if you had stood in line at 11 pm on Thanksgiving night. Look to Stack Coupon Codes – The idea of stacking coupons is one I have talked about before and it should not be overlooked on Cyber Monday. For example, just because a retailer might be offering free shipping on holiday shopping doesn’t mean you should be content with only free shipping. Be sure to look for a coupon code to stack on top of free shipping to maximize your savings. Start with Free Shipping. Be sure to start your Cyber Monday shopping at a retailer offering free shipping on your entire purchase then look for a coupon code to throw on top of your purchase for even more savings. To help you out, I created a list of 45+ retailers offering free shipping (with NO minimum) on your holiday shopping. It’s a great place to start. If you’re shopping on Cyber Monday and the deal looks too good to be true, trust your gut instinct and stay away. This is especially true if the deal or coupon is from a website with which you are not familiar with. Other signs of a fraudulent website include the lack of a contact phone number or a physical address. Also, don’t click unknown links in your email claiming to offer amazing Cyber Monday deals. Your best bet is to stick to brands and sites you are familiar with and have a proven track record of customer service and trustworthiness. Also, make sure your browser url changes from “http” to “https” on the website’s payment page, this ensures the site, and your credit card information, is secure. Bottom-line: Always trust your gut instinct. Ask the Reader: Are you planning on shopping on Cyber Monday? Any tips I may have missed? Let me know in the comments section below.

By Kyle James If you shop on Amazon often, you’ve probably wondered who would ever buy from a 3rd party seller when the price they offer is the same as Amazon’s. But due to high fees, did you know that often 3rd party sellers will sell to you directly at a price lower than Amazon? While this might not make sense on small purchases, it’s a pretty killer frugal hack to get a lower price on significant […] Continue Reading… If you’re not hacking Black Friday this year, you’re doing it all wrong.

Or maybe you’re already a Costco member, but when it comes to shopping for electronics, toys, and tools you have your favorite stores and would rather buy everything from a single place. While many retailers don’t consider “membership clubs” like Costco to be direct competitors, and thus won’t match their pricing, their are plenty who absolutely […] Continue Reading… A couple years ago Amazon created something called “Add-On” items. You’ve probably seen them. Their marked with a small “Add-on Item” badge next to the price they’re products which are really inexpensive and thus “cost-prohibitive to ship on their own.” Because of this, they require you to order at least $25 worth of merchandise to get the add-on price. Doesn’t matter if you’re a Prime member or not, you still need to spend at […] Continue Reading… There’s no doubt that retailers have figured out pricing tricks designed solely to separate you from your money. In fact, they often hire psychologists to determine how best to set their pricing and even how to set up store displays to get you to open your wallets wide. These pricing tricks exist because they absolutely work. They have even grown more elaborate as online shopping has flourished the past ten years. Here are six […] Continue Reading… Today I have a really short, but totally killer, Amazon hack for Prime members.
